      <span class="letter-open">Dear reader,</span>

      <p>Let me tell you what being a "good eater" is not. It is not counting macros. It is not guilt. It is not a war between you and your appetite. It is not the sad desk salad you eat while answering emails, barely tasting anything at all.</p>

      <p>Being a good eater is a philosophy. And like all good philosophies, it begins with paying attention.</p>

      <h2>The first principle: Presence</h2>

      <p>The French have a phrase &mdash; <em>la gourmandise</em> &mdash; which doesn't translate neatly into English. It's not gluttony. It's something closer to "the refined appreciation of food." The ability to be fully present with what you're eating. To notice the salt, the acid, the warmth. To let a meal be an experience rather than a task.</p>

      <p>Most of us have forgotten how to do this. We eat while scrolling. We eat while walking. We eat while thinking about everything except what's on the plate.</p>

      <blockquote>The woman who eats well is not the woman with the perfect diet. She is the woman who sits down.</blockquote>

      <h2>The second principle: Curiosity</h2>

      <p>A good eater is a curious eater. She asks: where did this come from? What makes a good olive oil different from a mediocre one? Why does this bread taste better than that bread? What happens when you salt an eggplant before roasting it?</p>

      <p>You don't need a culinary degree. You need the willingness to taste things, to experiment, to fail at a recipe and try again. Cooking is a skill, and like all skills, it rewards attention.</p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>A small practice to start</h3>
        <p>This week, cook one meal with no recipe. Open the fridge, see what you have, and make something. Season it with whatever feels right. Taste as you go. Don't photograph it. Just eat it &mdash; slowly, at a table, with no screen in front of you. Notice what that feels like.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The third principle: Nourishment over restriction</h2>

      <p>The diet industry has done something terrible to women: it has made us afraid of food. Afraid of carbs, of sugar, of fat, of eating too much, of wanting too much.</p>

      <p>I want to offer you a different framework. Instead of asking "what should I cut out?" ask: <em>what is my body asking for?</em></p>

      <p>Sometimes it's a bowl of warm soup with crusty bread. Sometimes it's a crisp salad with lemon and good olive oil. Sometimes it's chocolate. The body is wise. The body knows. Our work is not to override it but to listen.</p>

      <h2>The fourth principle: Feeding others as an act of love</h2>

      <p>There is a reason every culture on earth gathers around food. Cooking for someone is one of the most intimate things you can do. It says: I thought about you. I made this with my hands. I want you to be nourished.</p>

      <p>But here's the part we forget: <em>you</em> deserve that too. You deserve to cook for yourself with the same care you'd cook for a guest. To set the table even when you're eating alone. To use the nice plates.</p>

      <p>Because being a good eater starts with believing that you are worth feeding well.</p>
