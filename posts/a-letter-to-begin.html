    <div class="post-body">
      <span class="letter-open">Dear you,</span>

      <p>I know who you are. You're the woman who reads the back of every ingredient label. Who has a skincare routine that feels like a prayer. Who falls asleep with a book on her chest and wakes up thinking about something she wants to learn.</p>

      <p>You have always been told you're "too much." Too many interests, too many hobbies, too many tabs open in your brain. The world wants you to pick a lane. To specialize. To brand yourself as one thing.</p>

      <p>But here's what I believe, deeply and without compromise:</p>

      <blockquote>The most beautiful life a woman can live is one where she refuses to choose between her appetites.</blockquote>

      <p>You can be the woman who knows how to roast a chicken with herbs from her windowsill garden <em>and</em> the woman who can discuss Simone de Beauvoir over that dinner. You can care about the pH of your cleanser <em>and</em> the philosophy of Stoicism. You can meal-prep on Sunday <em>and</em> study Italian on Monday.</p>

      <p>This is not about doing everything. It's about doing the things that make you feel <em>alive</em>, and doing them well. Not perfectly. Well.</p>

      <h2>What this space is</h2>

      <p>Butteryellowkitchen is built around four pillars &mdash; four areas of life that I believe, when tended to with care, create a woman who is deeply nourished in every sense:</p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Nourish &mdash; The Art of Eating Well</h3>
        <p>Not dieting. Not counting. Eating with presence, with joy, with an understanding of what your body actually needs. Cooking as a form of love &mdash; for yourself first.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box blush">
        <h3>Tend &mdash; Skincare as Ritual</h3>
        <p>Your skin is not a project to fix. It's a living thing to care for. We'll talk ingredients, routines, and why the ten minutes you spend on your face each night are an act of radical self-respect.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box lavender">
        <h3>Learn &mdash; The Lifelong Student</h3>
        <p>Reading lists, thinking frameworks, language learning, deep dives into history and science and art. The goal is not to become an expert. The goal is to never stop being fascinated.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box sage">
        <h3>Master &mdash; The Polymath Spirit</h3>
        <p>How to do many things at your best. Time architecture, energy management, the philosophy of mastery. Not hustle culture. Something quieter and more sustainable than that.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Every post here is written like a letter &mdash; from me to you, from one woman who is trying to another who is too. There are no listicles here. No "10 hacks." Just honest, slow, thoughtful writing about how to build a life that feels like it actually belongs to you.</p>

      <h2>A small request</h2>

      <p>Read slowly. Bookmark things. Come back when you need a gentle nudge. This isn't content to consume &mdash; it's a conversation to return to.</p>

      <p>I'm so glad you're here.</p>

      <div class="letter-close">
        <p>With warmth and butter-yellow light,<br>Bhavya's Day</p>
