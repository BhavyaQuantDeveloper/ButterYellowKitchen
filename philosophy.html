    <div class="post-body">
      <span class="letter-open">A manifesto for the woman who contains multitudes.</span>

      <p>We believe that a well-lived life is not a minimized life. It is not a life reduced to one passion, one role, one identity. It is a life that is <em>full</em> &mdash; full of flavors, full of knowledge, full of care, full of depth.</p>

      <p>We believe in four things:</p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>I. Eat like it matters</h3>
        <p>Because it does. Food is not the enemy. Food is medicine, art, love, culture, memory, and pleasure &mdash; all at once. The woman who eats well is the woman who pays attention to what she puts in her body, who cooks with care, who sits down at the table and is fully present. She doesn't diet. She nourishes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box blush">
        <h3>II. Touch your own face with kindness</h3>
        <p>Skincare is the most intimate daily practice most of us have. It is the few minutes each day where we tend to ourselves &mdash; literally, with our own hands. We believe this is not vanity. It is a form of self-respect. A woman who takes care of her skin is a woman who has decided she is worth taking care of.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box lavender">
        <h3>III. Never stop being a student</h3>
        <p>Read books that challenge you. Learn a language that excites you. Study a subject that has nothing to do with your career. Ask questions. Take notes. Be a beginner, over and over again. The world rewards specialists. But the richest inner lives belong to generalists &mdash; to women who are curious about everything and ashamed of nothing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box sage">
        <h3>IV. Be a polymath, not an apologist</h3>
        <p>You do not owe anyone an explanation for your breadth. You do not need to justify why you care about nutrition and Nietzsche, about ceramics and coding, about French cooking and financial literacy. Depth in many areas is not distraction. It is richness. Own it. Master it. Let it make you extraordinary.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.15rem; margin-top: 2rem;">We believe in soft mornings and sharp minds.<br>In slow meals and fast learning.<br>In taking care of your skin and feeding your soul.<br>In doing everything at your best &mdash; not perfectly, but <em>beautifully</em>.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem;">This is the philosophy of Bhavya's Day.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the table.</p>
