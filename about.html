    <h1>About This Space</h1>
    <p class="about-subtitle">a kitchen table for the woman becoming herself</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>Butteryellowkitchen began as a simple idea: what if there was a place online that spoke to women the way a wise older sister would &mdash; warmly, honestly, without trying to sell anything?</p>

    <p>This is a space about living well in the truest sense. Not the Instagram version of wellness. Not the hustle-culture version of self-improvement. Something quieter. Something that feels like a long letter from a friend who wants the best for you.</p>

    <p>Here, we believe that a woman can be deeply interested in the philosophy of eating well <em>and</em> the science of skincare. That she can be a serious learner <em>and</em> a soft, gentle presence. That doing many things beautifully is not a flaw but a superpower.</p>

        <h3>Nourish</h3>
        <p>The philosophy and practice of eating well &mdash; with presence, curiosity, and joy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value-card">
        <h3>Tend</h3>
        <p>Skincare as ritual, self-care as self-respect, beauty as an inside-out practice.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value-card">
        <h3>Learn</h3>
        <p>Lifelong learning, reading widely, staying curious, and building a rich inner life.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value-card">
        <h3>Master</h3>
        <p>The polymath spirit &mdash; doing many things with depth, intention, and grace.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>Every post here is written like a letter. Because that's what this is, really &mdash; a conversation between women who are trying. Not performing. Not optimizing. Just trying to build lives that feel nourishing, beautiful, and deeply their own.</p>

    <p>If that resonates with you, you're in the right place. Pull up a chair. The kettle's on.</p>
